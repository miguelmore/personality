# Personality through Big Five from Selfies

## Portrait Personality dataset
In folder "dataset" you can find the Portrait Personality dataset of selfies based on the ChaLearn dataset First Impressions. Each selfie file was named with the prefix of the original video following by the frame's number, so in the file "bigfive_labels.csv" are stored all the labels where you can find the five values of each trait of the Big Five model using the prefix (name of the original video).
